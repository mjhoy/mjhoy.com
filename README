HACKING
        You will need GHC and cabal. I use nix to install these
        things. Once you have a working nix install, you can add a
        line such as this to your config.nix:

          mjhoy_com = haskellPackages.callPackage ~/path/to/mjhoy.com {};

        Then to step into an environment with the proper tools installed,

          $ nix-shell '<nixpkgs>' -A mjhoy_com

        This will install GHC, cabal, and the necessary haskell
        dependencies (Hakyll, etc.) At this point you can run:

          $ cabal build; cabal run -- -h

        and so on. You can run the `configure-dev` script first to
        make cabal link a little more quickly.

DEPLOY
        Easy. Simply `rsync` the _site directory up to a server somewhere.
        See deploy.example.
