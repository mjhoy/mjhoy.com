My website.


HACKING
        Easy. Use nix: https://nixos.org.

        Run `nix-shell` for a build environment. Use the shell-osx.nix
        file if you're on OSX (it adds Cocoa as a dependency, required
        for hsevents I believe.)

        $ cabal build
        $ cabal run build   # this generates the site.
        $ cabal run preview # development server.

DEPLOY
        Easy. Simply `rsync` the _site directory up to a server somewhere.
        See deploy.example.
