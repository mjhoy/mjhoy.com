<p class="intro">
  I am a [website developer][portfolio] living in Boston, Massachusetts. This
  web site is updated far less than I’d like it to be. In a perfect world, I’d
  have a blog post about lazily evaluated AI, only to spiral into digressions
  about the beauty of various species of mosses and fungi. To tie it together, a
  paragraph or two about tomatillo salsa. (One can dream.)
