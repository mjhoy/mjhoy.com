    <p>
      Let&rsquo;s say you want to call some block of code three times. Let&rsquo;s say
      that block of code happens to rotate a rectangle. OK, well, here’s some code that
      runs if you click it:
    </p>

<div id="page_1_box">

</div>

<pre class="clickable" id="page_1_rotate_click">
rect.rotate(60);
</pre>

    <p>
      Do it three times!
      (This is the real JavaScript, by the way, using the <a href="http://raphaeljs.com">Raphael</a> JavaScript
      vector graphics library.)
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s the equivalent of
    </p>
    <pre>
rect.rotate(60);
rect.rotate(60);
rect.rotate(60); </pre>
    <p>
      except that we get to see a nice spinning effect. Now, this repetition of code — as it is, just
      hard-coded to repeat three times — could be captured in an iteration:
    </p>
    <pre>
var i, n = 3;
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++ ) {
  rect.rotate(60)
} </pre>
    <p>
      This code effectively says: “Set <code>i</code> to 0 and <code>n</code> to 3. If <code>i</code> is less 
      than <code>n</code>, rotate the rectangle,
      and increment <code>i</code>. Repeat the ‘if’.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If we wanted to rotate four times, we'd just need to change <code>n</code>.
    </p>

  </div><!-- span-8 -->
</section><!-- /container -->

<section class="container">
  <div class="span-8">
    <header>
      <h1>Slightly more complex iteration</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      Now we want a rotation that applies
      itself to a copy of the previously rotated rectangle. The magical function
      that does this (implementation to be described below) can be clicked here:
    </p>


<div id="page_2_box">

</div>
<pre class="clickable" id="page_2_magical_click">
doSomethingMagical();
</pre>
    <p>
      Again, let’s say three times is our goal. How would we implement this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hard-coded, it might look like this:
    </p>
<pre>
var rect1 = paper.rect(0, 0, 10, 10); // Make a rect
var rect2 = paper.rect(0, 0, 10, 10).rotate(60); // Make a rect and rotate 60
var rect3 = paper.rect(0, 0, 10, 10).rotate(120); // Make a rect and rotate 120 </pre>
    <p>
      Pretty ugly, and not very reusable. (What if we’d rather it be 30 degrees, not 40?)
      An iterative procedure would look like:
    </p>
<pre>
var i, n = 3,
    lastRect = paper.rect(0, 0, 10, 10), 
    currentRect;

for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i ++) {
  currentRect = lastRect.clone().rotate(60);
  lastRect = currentRect;
} </pre>
    <p>
      To understand this, you need to know that <code>clone</code> makes a new
      object that has the attributes of its “master”, including rotation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In English this iteration is something like (excluding the initial state of variables):
      “If <code>i</code> is less than <code>n</code>, make a clone of <code>lastRect</code>
      and rotate it by 60 degrees. Assign the variable <code>lastRect</code> to the new
      clone, increment <code>i</code>, and repeat.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the iteration works by updating the variable 
      <code>lastRect</code> to point
      to whatever the last rectangle created was, so that, when it loops for the
      next time, it’s copying the <i>new</i> rectangle.
    </p>

      <h1>Higher-order functions</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      The idea of iteratively applying a transformation to a graphic — and by
      “iteratively” here I mean, as above, making copies as you go — isn’t really
      tied to whether that transformation is a rotation or a translation or
      whatever. Ideally, we could give a function (called “iterate” below)
      a base object, the number of times to apply an iteration, and
      the transformation function to run; e.g.
    </p>
<pre>
var rect = paper.rect(0, 0, 10, 10);
var fn = function (obj) { obj.translate(20, 0); };

iterate(rect, 3, fn); </pre>

    <p>
      Which would give us:
    </p>

<div id="page_3_box">

</div>

  <p>
    JavaScript nicely lets us capture the transformation function as a variable
    (“fn” above) and pass it as an argument to another function. The fact
    that <code>iterate</code> accepts a function as an argument means it is
    a “higher-order” function: a function which either accepts a function
    as input or produces one as output.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, what would the implementation of <code>iterate</code> look like?
  </p>

<pre>
var iterate = function(obj, n, fn) {
  if (!(n > 0)) {
    return;
  }
  newObj = obj.clone();
  fn(newObj);
  iterate(newObj, n - 1, fn);
};
</pre>

  <p>
    It’s similar in many ways to the <code>for</code> loops above. In English:
    “Return if <code>n</code> is not greater than 0. Make a clone of <code>obj</code>,
    and call <code>fn</code> passing in the newly created clone as an argument.
    Then <code>iterate</code> with the new object, 1 less than <code>n</code>,
    and <code>fn</code>.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Iterate calls itself repeatedly until <code>n</code> is 0, and each time
    it does it creates a new object, transforming it.
  </p>

      <h1>Symmetry functions</h1>
    </header>
    <div id="page_4_box">

    </div>
    <p>
      It’s possible, then, to describe <i>symmetries</i> of these vector objects
      with some ease in JavaScript, though certain kinds of operations are much 
      more simply described as a procedure than others. Translating, like above, is easy. 
      “Pivoting” objects around a point is more difficult: it requires tracking that point
      across function calls and determining its relation to the current
      object with some trig functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a bit more effort, it’s possible to wrap the symmetries produced in a object
      that can, itself, iterate. For instance, let’s say we have the following peculiar shape,
      produced by the following code:
    </p>

<pre>
var r = paper.partOfAnElizabethanStrap();
</pre>
  </div><!-- .span-8 -->
  <div class="span-8">

    <div id="page_4_box_2">

    </div>

    <p>
      Remember that <code>r</code> is the base Raphael object. Now we call <code>iterate</code>,
      but note this is a different <code>iterate</code> than the one above:
    </p>

<pre>
var r1 = r.iterate(1, function() {
  this.scale(-1, 1); // Reflect over y-axis
  this.translate(100, 0);
});
</pre>

    <div id="page_4_box_3">

    </div>

    <p>
      In this implementation of <code>iterate</code> I’m doing something special. It accepts a 
      number of iterations to perform and a function as its
      arguments. The function is called in the context of the cloned objects, and so I apply the
      transformations to <code>this</code>. The result of <code>iterate</code> I put in a variable
      <code>r1</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>r1</code> is <i>not</i> the cloned object that’s been moved and reflected. It’s the
      group of both of those objects; the result of the iteration. And the iteration can itself be
      iterated, which lets us say:
    </p>

<pre>
r2 = r1.iterate(1, function() {
  this.rotateAround(180, 50, -45);
  this.translate(-50, 0);
});
</pre>

    <div id="page_4_box_4">

    </div>
    <p>
      This pivots and translates the symmetry group <code>r1</code>
      as a whole. The “pivoting” is done by a method called <code>rotateAround</code>. 
      The result, which is all four objects, is stored in <code>r2</code>. To finish:
    </p>
<pre>
r3 = r2.iterate(4, function() {
  this.translate(100, 0);
});
</pre>

    <div id="page_4_box_5">

    </div>

    <p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">
      You can see my implementation of <code>iterate</code> at 
      <a href="https://github.com/mjhoy/symmetry-js/blob/master/src/symmetry.raphael.js">Github</a>. 
      (There’s also an implementation of <code>rotateAround</code>).
      Note that it’s very
      proof-of-concept and experimental now. There’s currently some bugs when using multiple
      calls to <code>rotate</code> and <code>rotateAround</code> over iterations. 
      If only I knew my trig.

      The “peculiar shape” is the reverse-engineering of a strap ornament pattern from Elizabethan
      England. The figure above, demonstrating how elements might pivot, is from an Arabian tile design
      pattern. Both were
      found in the wonderful <em>Handbook of Regular Patterns</em> by Peter S. Stevens
      (which more or less inspired this post).
