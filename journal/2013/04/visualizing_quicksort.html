<p>
  There are three parts to quicksort. For an array, (1) choose a
  “pivot” item. Using the pivot, (2) partition the array around the
  pivot, such that the array to the left of the pivot is less than the
  pivot; the array to the right of the pivot is greater than the
  pivot. Finally, (3) invoke quicksort recursively on the left and
  right partitions.
</p>


<p>
  Recursion can be tricky to understand. Using d3.js, we can represent
  each recursive call to quicksort as a node, whose parent is the
  array of which it is a partition, and whose children are its
  partitions. The base case is when the array is only one element —
  this is the state of the leaf nodes.
</p>

<p>
  Pivot elements are highlighted red. Sorted arrays have a black
  circle node; unsorted are light gray. Choosing the pivot is
  simplified: the first element is picked.
</p>

<p>
  The graph (once sorted) often has an interesting property. If you
  read top to bottom, left to right, following the pivot elements
  (those highlighted in red), you will read the final sorted array.

<p>
  The layout is generated using d3.layout.tree.
